    <div class="flex mb-8">
      <div class="my-auto">
        <p>
          Maven NFT is your central shopping center for Asset Based NFTs. Please
          see our “What is an NFT” for more information on NFTs (Non-Fungible
          Tokens). Maven focuses only on NFTs that represent real world assets.
          There are many sites that focus on digital art and gaming NFTs, but
          Maven is about tangible things. For example, you can own the rights to
          an avocado farm’s production earnings or a vacation home on a tropical
          beach (not a digital representation of a home , but a real home that
          you can live in! As we grow, we will continue to add more and more
          real-world assets that you can buy through our marketplace with
          cryptocurrency. So enjoy the lighter side of NFTs on other sites, but
          come back to Maven to purchase true tangible assets with an NFT proof
          of ownership.
        </p>

    <h2 class="mb-10">What’s special about Maven?</h2>

    <div class="flex mb-8">
      <div class="my-auto">
        <p>
          Other than the fact that we only deal in real world assets, Maven NFT
          is based on the Liquid Network side chain which is based on the
          Bitcoin blockchain. What that means to you is it is a native Bitcoin
          marketplace and the gas fees (the transactional costs to purchase NFTs
          on our marketplace) are a fraction of those based on the Ethereum
          block chain. And the Liquid network is FAST! So, you don’t have to
          wait around nervously to see your ownership of your new NFT since it
          happens almost instantaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Liquid Network also supports native asset issuance and atomic
          swaps which is a fancy way of saying it is possible for people who
          don't know or necessarily even trust each other to exchange their
          different tokens and assets directly in a single transaction without
          needing to go through a 3rd party escrow agent.

          The letters NFT stand for Non-Fungible Token. Ok, so what does
          fungible mean?! Good question, it’s not a commonly used word. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Fungible means something that is not particularly unique and can be
          replaced by something just like it. For example, if you have a dollar
          bill in your wallet and your friend has one, you can exchange your
          dollar bills with each other and you have the same value and really
          your life hasn’t changed much! So money is fungible, gold is fungible,
          heck your coffee table is fungible and can be replaced with an
          identical one if needed. But you are Non-fungible! You are unique. So
          is the Mona Lisa painting or that old car your friend is restoring.
          There is no one just like you or a painting just like the Mona Lisa!
          Unique things are non-fungible. 
        </p>

        <p>
          A token is basically a voucher that serves as a representation of an
          item. A movie ticket is a token for example. It represents your right
          to enter the theatre and see the movie. 
        </p>

        <p>
          So a Non-Fungible Token is a unique representation of ownership.
          Recently, NFTs have become very popular as digital contracts or “smart
          contracts”. They are stored online in digital form and are made
          unchangeable, secure and private by using blockchain technology.

    <h2 class="mb-10">Ok, so what’s a blockchain?!</h2>

    <div class="flex mb-8">
      <div class="my-auto">



        <p>
A blockchain is just a collection of transactions, or items, like the lines of groceries in your grocery list. Each grocery item is like the transactions in a block and the whole grocery list is a block of information. On a blockchain, blocks of information are tied together and connected into a chain of blocks. So your grocery list tied to your neighbors grocery list, and to another one and so on creates a chain of blocks of information… aka a blockchain!
</p>

<p>
The power of blockchain technology is that it isn’t just stored on one computer. It’s stored on hundreds or thousands around the world. So it makes it very difficult to hack (change the information) because if one copy on one computer changes it is compared to the others and they quickly figure out something is wrong. And it is disallowed. No particular person, company or government is in charge of the group of computers maintaining the blockchain. So the information is very secure. 
</p>

<p>
So…an NFT is really a unique digital contract stored all over the world at once in a very secure way. And this is powerful and it is changing the world and the way business is done!
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, early uses of NFTs has been very heavily slanted towards digital art. And often pretty weird digital art! Not that artwork is a bad example of something that can be owned through an NFT, but that is just one of a million examples of what NFTs can be used for. 
</p>


<p>Your NFTs can be traded on the Maven NFT marketplace, an online NFT marketplace that specializes in NFTs that represent real world assets or tangible things. With your NFT able to be sold on the marketplace, it means your NFT has liquidity. You can put it up for sale, you can trade it for other NFTs or you can hold it and reap the harvest production earnings over time. </p>

<p>
Now that you understand what an NFT is and what it can do, we hope you choose to join our Vida Verde family and become an owner of one or more of our unique NFTs.
