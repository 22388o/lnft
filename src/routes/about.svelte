    <div class="flex mb-8">

        <p>
          Maven NFT is your central shopping center for Asset Based NFTs. Please
          see our “What is an NFT” for more information on NFTs (Non-Fungible
          Tokens). Maven focuses only on NFTs that represent real world assets.
          There are many sites that focus on digital art and gaming NFTs, but
          Maven is about tangible things. For example, you can own the rights to
          an avocado farm’s production earnings or a vacation home on a tropical
          beach (not a digital representation of a home , but a real home that
          you can live in! As we grow, we will continue to add more and more
          real-world assets that you can buy through our marketplace with
          cryptocurrency. So enjoy the lighter side of NFTs on other sites, but
          come back to Maven to purchase true tangible assets with an NFT proof
          of ownership.

    <h3 class="mb-10">What’s special about Maven?</h3>

    <div class="flex mb-8">
      <div class="my-auto">
        <p>
          Other than the fact that we only deal in real world assets, Maven NFT
          is based on the Liquid Network side chain which is based on the
          Bitcoin blockchain. What that means to you is it is a native Bitcoin
          marketplace and the gas fees (the transactional costs to purchase NFTs
          on our marketplace) are a fraction of those based on the Ethereum
          block chain. And the Liquid network is FAST! So, you don’t have to
          wait around nervously to see your ownership of your new NFT since it
          happens almost instantaneously.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Liquid Network also supports native asset issuance and atomic
          swaps which is a fancy way of saying it is possible for people who
          don't know or necessarily even trust each other to exchange their
          different tokens and assets directly in a single transaction without
          needing to go through a 3rd party escrow agent.
