        <p>
          We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us
          which may contain personal information. For example, when you create
          your user account we may collect your username and email address. We
          retain this information until you ask to be removed from the Website.

          artwork samples, information about your promoting sites (website or
          other social platforms) and other information about your art. In

          shipping information (such as name and mailing address) from you in
          order to ship the items to you. We do not sell or otherwise transmit
          any such actively-collected personal information to third parties
          other than to third party service providers discussed in Section 4.
        </p>

        <h4>Passive Collection of Information</h4>

          automatically collected. This information includes your IP address,
          access times, browser type and language, and referring web site
          addresses. We collect this information to troubleshoot technical
          issues, understand how visitors use our website, provide an experience
          relevant to the general location associated with your IP address, and
          to make improvements to our website. If you arrive at our website by
          clicking a link, then we may capture information that tracks your

          We may place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit to help
          us identify the number of unique visitors to our website, whether or

          services.

          not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not make any representations
          about third-party websites. We encourage you to review their privacy
