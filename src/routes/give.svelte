        Help Them Help Themselves has been working in Nicaragua and other
        Central American countries for over a decade and has provided homes,
        schools, and medical clinics to communities in need. HTHT has also
        organized dozens of medical and dental missions providing tens of
        thousands of dollars worth of care to local people that simply do not
        have access to proper health care.

        Vida Verde Agroforestry is proud to work with the Help Them Help
        Themselves Foundation not only to provide a better life for people in
        the area of our projects but also for our furry and scaly friends as
        well! We have supported many spay and neuter clinics in the villages to
        help the dog and cat population. We are also very proud to have created
        Giant Sea Turtle sanctuaries that allow us to save turtle eggs from
        poachers and release the hatchlings into the ocean safely! When Giant
        Sea Turtles eggs are left in nests in the wild, statistics show that
        they have less than a 5% chance of hatching and surviving to be adult
        turtles. But when cared for and released properly by a turtle sanctuary
        like ours, their odds jump to an amazing 95% survival rate! Vida Verde
        Agroforestry and Help Them Help Themselves have released thousands of
        Giant Sea Turtles back into the ocean and are proud to be making a
        difference.
