    <p>
      Combining a short time frame bearing fruit such as avocado with a
      longer-term hardwood such as teak makes for an extremely strong earth
      friendly, agroforestry investment that not only produces an excellent
      anticipated ROI but is also an investment you can feel good about.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the stock market can be highly volatile and the worldâ€™s economy can
      be devastated by pandemics, teak trees continue to grow and avocado trees
      continue to bear fruit.
